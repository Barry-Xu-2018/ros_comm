1. Background/Overview
---------------------
 this repository is to develop and distribute the Unix Domain Socket
 feature extension for ROS message transmission layer. if the system
 internal message use only, TCP/IP, UDP/IP protocal stack does not do
 any good to the system, just a pure overhead. so then Unix Domain
 Socket (UDS) is reasonable to get rid of the overhead with the system
 internal use for ROS Inter-Process Communication.


2. Unix Domain Socket(UDS) feature
----------------------------------
  a) How to use in runtime.
     - for runtime, UDS feature is provided as BAS package for projects.
       1st of all, you do need to install the BAS package as well.
     - set environment variable 'ROS_UDS_EXT_ENABLE=on' to turn on the
       UDS feature enabled, before running the applilcation.
       e.g) # ROS_UDS_EXT_ENABLE=on roscore
            # ROS_UDS_EXT_ENABLE=on rosrun test_rosuds talker_uds
            # ROS_UDS_EXT_ENABLE=on rosrun test_rosuds listener_uds
     - if the environment variable is not set,
       TCP/IP or UDP/IP(default ROS communication) will be used.

  b) Limitations.
     - UDS feature is supported only roscpp, nothing else.
     - UDS feature is exlusive from TCP/UDP IP default comm on each process.
       you can not use UDS feature and TCP/UDP IP comm on the same process.
     - No tools are suppoted via UDS feature. (might work but not confirmed)

     (*) since a few development steps we make, there are some strong limitaions
         at this time. but these are the limitation not specifications, we are
         trying to get rid of the limitations for close future.

  b) Devel environment.
     - you can use this repository in your catkin environment, all you need to
       do is the following.
       # cd <CATKIN_WORkSPACE>/src
       # git clone ros_comm-kinetic-devel
       # cd <CATKIN_WORkSPACE>
       # catkin_make
       # source devel/setup.bash


3. Debian
---------
  this description is most likely for developpers.

  a) CHANGELOG.rst
     we do not maintenance CHANGELOG.rst, just use the original files which
     are provided ROS mainline repository.
     (*) only exception, at the rebase from the mainline release, we will change
         the date of the CHANGELOG.rst which belongs to our targeted packages.
         so then the version number attached with debian package is newer than
         original, and apt-get can automatically install our modified packages.
  b) Debian metadata
     - use the following command to make debian metadata on each package we modify.
       # bloom-generate rosdebian --os-name ubuntu --os-version xenial --ros-distro kinetic
     - the debian metadata should be created only for the packages we release.
     - for test purpose, you can build the debian packages with the following command.
       # fakeroot debian/rules binary
  c) Copylight
     - currently debian copylight is not our scope, since there are no sony specific pacakges.
     - when the time comes, we will follow the basics below.
